## ❓ Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

**Q: Is Bunni completely free?**
A: Yes! Bunni is 100% free. We use a short, non-intrusive key system to support our server costs and development time.

**Q: Why does my antivirus flag the download?**
A: This is a "False Positive." Because executors function by injecting code into another program (Roblox), antivirus software mistakenly identifies this behavior as a virus. You will need to whitelist the folder to use it.

**Q: How do I fix the "DLL Missing" error?**
A: This usually happens if your antivirus deleted a file during installation. Disable your real-time protection temporarily, reinstall Bunni, and add the folder to your exclusion list.

**Q: Does it work on Mac or Mobile?**
A: Currently, Bunni is exclusive to Windows. We are exploring mobile options for late 2025, but for now, it is a PC-only tool.

**Q: How often is it updated?**
A: We update the software every Wednesday immediately following the weekly Roblox patch to ensure continued functionality.
